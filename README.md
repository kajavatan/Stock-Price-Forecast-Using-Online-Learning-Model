# Stock Price Forecast Using Online Learning Model

## Introduction

Continuous variation in stock market lays people into confusion. Forecasting stock price in real time imposes a challenge for human as it is rather difficult to find the underlying patterns or relationships in the massive amount of data when the data coming in are continuous and ever-changing. This project aims to develop a robust predictive model to forecast the stock market trend using real-time financial time series data, by extending Online Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine (OR-ELM) algorithm, and introducing two optimization strategies: adaptive forgetting factor (AFF) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). A comparative study is carried out to compare the forecasting performance of existing algorithms with the implemented algorithm (ORELM-AFF-GA). 

## Dataset
**Nikkei 225**
- A stock market index for Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)
- Intra-day historical data obtained from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)
- Period: 1/3/1966 to 29/2/2018

3. **Online Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Forgetting Factor (ORELM-AFF) (PROPOSED)**
- Integrates OR-ELM with adaptive forgetting factor (FF) to handle time-varying sequential data, since a constant forgetting factor may not be sufficient to track all the system dynamics
- With this forgetting mechanism, the forgetting factor, Î» will be adjusted based on the changes of the data characteristics.
- Specifically, when there is a abrupt change in the data distribution, a smaller forgetting factor will be used to adapt to the trend and discard the older data that will bring negative effect on the prediction accuracy. On the contrary, a larger forgetting factor will be used when the trend is steadier to increase the memory length of the algorithm. 
- The recursive update of the forgetting factor was adopted from the research conducted by Li, Zhang, Yin, Xiao & Zhang (2017).

4. **Online Recurrent Extreme Learning Machine with Adaptive Forgetting Factor and Genetic Algorithm (ORELM-AFF-GA) (PROPOSED)**
- Added Steady State Genetic Algorithm Genetic Algorithm (GA) for hyperparamater optimization.
- Efficiently select optimal parameters (window size and number of hidden neurons) in a large complex search space.

 Below figure depicts a 3-dimensional scatter plot showing the distribution of the solutions generated using GA where a lighter-colored point indicates better solution sets and darker-colored point represents weaker solution sets.

## Requirements 
- Python 2.7
- Expsuite (included in this repository)

## Usage

Run prediction code:

    python run.py 
    
Use *-a* to run other algorithms (OSELM or ORELM). For example:

    python run.py -a OSELM
    
## Result
**ORELM-AFF-GA** shows superior performance in capturing the non-linearity and predicting the stock price.
